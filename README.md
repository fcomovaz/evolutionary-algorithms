# Metaheuristic Algorithms Module

> This module is a collection of metaheuristic/bio-inspired/evolutionary algorithms implemented in Python. The design is oriented to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on readability and modularity.

## Installation

Just clone the repository and import the module in your project. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file, so you can import only the ones you need.

Additionally, each algorithm has a minimal example in the same folder.

## Algorithms

- [Genetic Algorithm](GeneticAlgorithm/)


## Examples & Usage

The minimal usage example for each algorithm is in the corresponding folder. The problems selected for the examples are simple and easy to understand:
1. **Binary Knapsack Problem**: A combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.
2. **Continuous Optimization Problem**: A simple optimization problem where the goal is to find the minimum of a function.
3. **Traveling Salesman Problem**: A combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest path that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the origin city.
